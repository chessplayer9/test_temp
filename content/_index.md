  #       <style>.text {font-size: 18px;line-height: 1.6;}strong {font-weight: bold;color: red;}</style><div class="text">The advancement of remote sensing, including satellite systems, facilitates the continuous acquisition of remote sensing imagery globally, introducing novel challenges for achieving open-world tasks. Deployed models need to continuously adjust to a constant influx of new data, which frequently showcases diverse shifts from the data encountered during the training phase. To effectively handle the new data, models are required to detect semantic shifts, adapt to covariate shifts, and continuously update the parameters without forgetting learned knowledge, which has been considered in works on a variety of open-world tasks. However, existing studies are typically conducted within a single dataset to simulate realistic conditions, with a lack of large-scale benchmarks capable of evaluating multiple open-world tasks. We introduce <strong>OpenEarthSensing (OES)</strong>, a large-scale fine-grained benchmark for open-world remote sensing. OES includes 189 scene and objects categories, covering the vast majority of potential semantic shifts that may occur in the real world. Additionally, to provide a more comprehensive testbed for evaluating the generalization performance, OES encompasses five data domains with significant covariate shifts, including two RGB satellite domains, one RGB aerial domain, one multispectral RGB domain, and one infrared domain. We evaluate the baselines and existing methods of diverse tasks on OES, demonstrating that it serves as a meaningful and challenging benchmark for open-world remote sensing.</div>
